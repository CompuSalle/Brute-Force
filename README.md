**Please use python3.**

Note:
1. This program only brute force password on the run, not brute forcing password over different URLs or systems, however, it can be converted to brute force whatever fits the purpose of using this program.
2. This program can brute force passwords with a length of 1 to 7, however, it can be modified to crack passwords with a longer length.
3. This program cracks only lowercase letters and numbers, but also can be modified to crack uppercase and special letters. For that please refer to my password list generator, which can generate all kinds of passwords and understand the algorithm that has been uesd, as both are similar.


<b>password list generator/cracker</b> can crack passwords using a password list, if that is what you are searching for.
