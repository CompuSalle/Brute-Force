**Please use python3.**

Note:
1. This program only brute force password on the run, not brute forcing password over different URLs or systems, however, it can be converted to brute force whatever fits the purpose of using this program.
2. This program can brute force passwords with a length of 1 to 7, however, it can be modified to crack passwords with a longer length.
3. This program cracks only lowercase letters and numbers, but also can be modified to crack uppercase and special letters. For that please refer to my password list generator, which can generate all kinds of passwords and understand the algorithm that has been uesd, as both are similar.


<b>password list generator/cracker</b> can crack passwords using a password list, if that is what you are searching for.
Refer to [This Project](https://github.com/CompuSalle/Password-List-Generator-Cracking).

> Program Explanation

The user shall choose to preside with section ‘a’; therefore, the user will enter a password
combination of only numbers/lowercase or both. If the user enters more than six inputs or enters
invalid inputs, errors will be handled professionally to explain what is wrong with the user.


Algorithm:
The user will insert a pass.

A (for loop) will start in the range of 1 – 6 to generate the brute pass list from (0 or z) to (999999
or zzzzzz). Any capital letter will automatically be converted to lowercase.


The user password should be found as time passes. The brute speed depends on the computer
aspects.
