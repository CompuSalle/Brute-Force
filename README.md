Can be used in your project. 
Name maintaining would be nice. <3


Please use python3. 

Note:
1) This program can brute force passwords with a length of 1 to 7, however, it can be modified to crack passwords with a longer length.
2) This program cracks only lowercase letters and numbers, but also can be modified to crack uppercase and special letters. For that please refer to my password list generator, which can generate all kinds of passwords and understand the algorithm that has been uesd, as both are similar.



Have Fun !
